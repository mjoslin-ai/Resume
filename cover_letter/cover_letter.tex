Dear Hiring Manager,
\\
\\
I am excited to apply for the \position{} position at \company{}. My passion for leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights began during my undergraduate studies when I discovered the field of data science. The opportunity to collaborate with professionals dedicated to the research in the automotive industry aligns with my enthusiasm for better mobility. \company{}’s focus on both classic and vitual development makes this role particularly appealing to me.
\\
\\
During my time at the Global Center for Automotive Performance Simulation (GCAPS), I gained valuable experience working with Virginia Tech Transportation Institute’s (VTTI’s) naturalistic driving data (NDD). I conducted exploratory analysis on highway cut-in and lane change maneuvers, providing the Division of Data and Analytics at VTTI with enhanced insights into the factors affecting these maneuvers, expanding conventional domain knowledge. I also maintained an internal database and developed an interactive website supporting the simulation team’s virtual reconstruction of the NDD — a resource that enhanced their daily workflow. As a \position{}, I would apply these technical and analytical skills—paired with a strong commitment to learning the nuances of finance—to effectively support the accounting department’s operations and decision-making.
\\
\\
I may have a gap in my employment history due to my health; however, I’m excited to start making a difference at \company{}. In my spare time, I actively educate myself on all things finance from macro economics to individual stocks and crypto—a mindset that is beneficial in a finance role and \company{}’s view on the importance of continued learning. Additionally, I'm intimately aware how important our health becomes when not functioning properly, which gives me purpose to advance the automotive industry.
\\
\\
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about the \position{} position at \company{}.
\\
\\
Sincerely,
\\
Mark Joslin
