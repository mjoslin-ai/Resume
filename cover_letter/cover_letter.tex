Dear Hiring Manager,
\\
\\
I am excited to apply for the \position{} position at \company{}. My passion for leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights began during my undergraduate studies when I discovered the field of data science. The opportunity to collaborate with professionals dedicated to [in about page] aligns with my enthusiasm for [passion]. \company{}’s focus on [community impact] makes this role particularly appealing to me.
\\
\\
During my time at the Global Center for Automotive Performance Simulation (GCAPS), I gained valuable experience working with Virginia Tech Transportation Institute’s (VTTI’s) naturalistic driving data (NDD). I conducted database management and exploratory analysis on highway cut-in and lane change maneuvers, updating and maintaining the SQL database to document how simulation-based scenarios are constructed from the NDD. Additionally, I developed a website that allowed users to easily interact with and visualize progress toward completion. Beyond SQL, I honed my analytical problem-solving skills through a lane change exploratory analysis using Python. This analysis provided the Division of Data and Analytics at VTTI with enhanced insights into the factors affecting these maneuvers, expanding conventional domain knowledge. As a \position{}, I would bring these skills to [job responsibility].
\\
\\
I may have a gap in my employment history due to my health; however, I’m excited to start making a difference at \company{}. In my spare time, I actively educate myself on [hobbies related to job]—subjects that closely align with \company{}’s mission to [company mission]. Additionally, [personal statement].

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to learning more about the \position{} at \company{}.
